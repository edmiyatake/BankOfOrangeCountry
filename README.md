# BankOfOrangeCountry
A data-structureâ€“driven simulation of a commercial banking system built entirely from scratch using linked lists and custom class design. This project re-implements typical banking operations (account creation, payments, merging, etc.) while focusing on algorithmic correctness, data integrity, and efficient memory management.
